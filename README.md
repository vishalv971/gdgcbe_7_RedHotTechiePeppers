Nowadays, almost a lakh vehicles pass through a toll booth everyday. An average time of 40 seconds is spent at every toll in validating each vehicle. Owing to these factors, there is an accumulation of vehicles leading to long queues and congestion at a toll booth. Hence we end up wasting a lot of time in this process.

So, we formulated a solution to the above said problem, by using Image Recognition Techniques and drastically reducing the waiting time at a toll booth.

Project Overview

Our project will be implementing:

Cameras placed at every toll junction to capture the number plate of the incoming car.

Once the car has passed by, the captured number plate is processed using Image Processing techniques to check for car number in the central database.

If the said car number is found in the database, the toll amount is deducted from the connected account.

The user will be notified of the deducted amount immediately.

Existing Systems:

Manual Toll Collection: The toll is manually collected by a person sitting at booth which results in formation of queues at peak hours ending up in more congestion.

Radio Frequency Identification Toll Collection (RFID): The user is issued a RFID tag which has to be scanned at a booth which also involves the vehicle stopping at the booth.

Our system solves the aforementioned problems by automating the entire toll collection process using image recognition techniques and cameras.
